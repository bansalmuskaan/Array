An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. An array is used to store a collection of data , but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Under this repo I had committed basic to intermediate arrays programs using C++.

This repo mainly follows all commonly questions and solutions which I had practise during my college year.

Sources of all these questions are various online coding platforms.
